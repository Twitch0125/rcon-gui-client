# Dead Project
The good old days... I had started this when I was first learning web development, and I think I chose a reasonable direction by using Feathers and Nuxt, but I clearly had no idea what I was doing (as pointed out by my commits). I actually think this would be much easier to do with Nuxt 3, since it has a more streamlined approach to server-side only code.
I think this was also around the time I was first messing with TailwindCSS.
Anyway, I'm archiving this just so I can re-visit my younger self's stuff.

# mcrconapp

> My superior Nuxt.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
